# polyglot_aoc_2022
Advent of Code 2022 in many programming languages

# F#
At the time of this project I am still fairly new to F#, but this language is very enjoyable to work in.

# C#
At the time of this project I would say I am an expert in C#

# C++
At the time of this project I am rather rusty (pun intended) in C++

# Rust
Rewrite it all in Rust

# Typescript
Against my will, I am learning this language
