# polyglot_aoc_2022
Advent of Code 2022 in many programming languages

# F#
At the time of this project I am still fairly new to F#, but this language is very enjoyable to work in.

# C#
At the time of this project I would say I am an expert in C# - I may not complete the puzzles in this because I write enough of this langauge elsewhere

# C++
At the time of this project I am rather rusty (pun intended) in C++. This language sucks, I spit it from my mouth!

# Rust
Rewrite it all in Rust, still learning, looking for my favorite speedy language

# Typescript
Against my will, I am learning this language. Intending to do a lot more

# C
Writing some C for fundamentals

# Zig
Testing things out, looking for my favorite speedy language

# Go
Starting a deep dive, intending to take this a long way
